# Tamagapuri

In the late 90s, Bandai released to the world the “Tamagotchi!” It was AWESOME! I was only 7 years old, but they were wildly popular, many iterations came after, and by the early 2000s, I got to play with one! I was hooked. I still love the concept of a virtual pet to take care of. Probably because I don’t trust myself with a real pet. Especially after I heard a weird sound coming from my Tamagotchi and saw my frog like creature in angel wings to signify that I had in fact killed my pet. It was… traumatizing.

This is the inspiration behind Tamagapuri! According to wikipedia, Tamagotchi, “the name is a portmanteau combining the two Japanese words tamago (たまご), which means “egg”, and uotchi (ウオッチ) “watch”.

Well since my project isn’t on a handheld device, or at least not a watch, I created my own portmanteau of Tamago and Apuri (アプリ) which means “App”!
